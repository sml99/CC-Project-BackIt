# Hito 2: Testing

## Introduction

In this hito, I have implemented testing strategies for the project, focusing on task runners, creating test objects, and executing tests. The selected tools are **Yarn** as the task runner and **Jest** as the assertion library and test framework. This submission provides insights into the rationale behind these choices, along with relevant screenshots.

## Task 1: Task Runners or Task Managers

### Description
For this project, I have chosen **Yarn** as the task runner to execute tests.

### Justification
Yarn is a reliable and efficient package manager that seamlessly integrates with the project workflow. Its deterministic package resolution ensures consistency across different environments, making it an ideal choice for managing project dependencies and tasks.

## Task 2: Creating Test Objects

### Description
I have opted for **Jest** as the assertion library for easy comparison between expected and actual results.

### Justification
Jest is a comprehensive testing framework that not only provides powerful assertion capabilities but also includes built-in features like test runners and code coverage analysis. Its simplicity and versatility make it an excellent choice for my testing needs.

## Task 3: Executing Tests

### Description
The test runner chosen for this project is **Jest**, which efficiently locates, executes, and reports on tests.

### Justification
Jest's built-in test runner, along with its seamless integration with Yarn, simplifies the testing process. Its ability to parallelize test runs and provide detailed feedback makes it a suitable choice for ensuring code quality.
